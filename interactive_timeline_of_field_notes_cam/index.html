<h3>Interactive timeline of field notes</h3>
<p>As described in the paper, we used this project as an opportunity to investigate new ways
of approaching, recording, and reporting design study research. In support of this learning, 
we decided early on to capture notes and insights as frequently as possible both for our own 
reflective analysis and for auditing by others for validation. We adopted a practice of taking 
field notes following meaningful interactions, providing a log through which we could trace 
the development of insights and ideas. While we are limited in what we can share due to the nature 
of the project domain, we offer an interactive timeline of high-level summaries as a first step toward these efforts. 
By doing this we hope to contribute to an ongoing dialogue within the visualization community 
surrounding the recording and reporting of design study research process and findings</p>


<p>The timeline may be viewed here: <a href="timeline.html">Interactive timeline of field notes</a></p>

<p>The timeline was built using the D3 Javascript Library. Hovering over or clicking nodes in the timeline 
reveals the associated field note summary. Brush filters support filtering across time periods. Hovering over the colored rectangles above the timeline reveals overview details about the various stages of the study.</p>
<p><strong>Please note that running the interactive timeline requires an internet connection, as the D3 Javascript Library must be loaded directly from d3js.org.</strong></p>
